Explanation:

We need to find the common characters in a list of strings. Here's a summary of the approach:

1. **`fillCountArray` Method**:
    - This helper method takes a string and an array of 26 integers (representing counts for each letter of the alphabet).
    - It increments the counts for each character in the string.

2. **`commonChars` Method**:
    - **Initialization**:
        - The method initializes a vector of strings (result) to store the common characters
        - It also initializes an integer array count of size 26 to keep track of character frequencies in the first word
    - **Count Update**:
        - It calls fillCountArray on the first word to populate count
        - Then, for each subsequent word, it uses a temporary count array temp to store character frequencies
        - For each character, it updates count to the minimum frequency of that character between the current count and temp
    - **Result Construction**:
        - Finally, it iterates over the count array, and for each non-zero count, it adds the corresponding character to the result the number of times it appears
    - **Return**:
        - The method returns the vector of common characters

In essence, the solution identifies the minimum frequency of each character across all words and constructs the list of common characters based on these frequencies.




```cpp
// Approach (Simple iteration)
// TC: O(n*w), w = average length of each word. and n = number of words
// SC: O(1)

class Solution {
public:

    // Store the freq of word[0]
    void fillCountArray(string& word, int count[26]) {
        for (char& ch : word) {
            count[ch - 'a']++;
        }
    }

    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();

        vector<string> result;
        int count[26] = {0};
        fillCountArray(words[0], count);

        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {

            int temp[26] = {0};
            fillCountArray(words[i], temp);

            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (count[i] != temp[i])
                    count[i] = min(count[i], temp[i]);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count[i] != 0) {
                int c = count[i];
                while (c--) {
                    result.push_back(string(1, i + 'a'));
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};

```
