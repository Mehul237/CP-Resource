## Approach 1:

### Intuition:
- This approach uses a stack to keep track of characters.
- It iterates through the input string `s` and compares each character with the top of the stack.
- If the current character and the top of the stack form a pair of the same letter but different cases, they are removed from the stack. Otherwise, the current character is pushed onto the stack.
- Finally, the characters remaining in the stack are concatenated to form the resulting string.

### Time Complexity:
- Since each character is pushed or popped at most once from the stack, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, due to the stack used to store characters.






```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) {

    stack<char>st;

    for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++) {
        if(st.empty()) {
            st.push(s[i]);
            continue;
          }

        if(abs(st.top() - s[i]) == 32) {
            st.pop();
        } else {
            st.push(s[i]);
        }
    }
    
    string ans;
    
    while(!st.empty()) {
            ans = st.top() + ans;
            st.pop();
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

```

## Approach 2:

### Intuition:
- This approach iterates through the input string `s`.
- It constructs the resulting string `ans` by appending characters from `s`.
- It continuously checks if the last character appended to `ans` forms a pair with the next character in `s`. If they do, both characters are removed from `ans`.
- This process continues until there are no more characters left to check in `s`.

### Time Complexity:
- In the worst-case scenario, each character is appended to `ans` and then removed, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, due to the resulting string `ans`.


## Approach 3:

### Intuition:
- Similar to Approach 2, this approach iterates through the input string `s`.
- It constructs the resulting string `ans` by appending characters from `s`.
- It checks if the last character appended to `ans` forms a pair with the current character in `s`. If they do, both characters are removed from `ans`.
- This process continues until there are no more characters left to check in `s`.

### Time Complexity:
- Similar to Approach 2, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, due to the resulting string `ans`.


```cpp

// Approach: 2 
class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) {
        string ans = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            ans += s[i];
            while (ans.size() > 0 && abs(s[i + 1] - ans.back()) == 32) {
                ans.pop_back();
                i++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};


// Approach: 3

class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) {
        string ans = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (ans.size() == 0 || tolower(s[i]) != tolower(ans.back()) || s[i] == ans.back()) {
                ans += s[i];
            } else {
                ans.pop_back();
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

```

## Approach 4:

### Intuition:
- This approach iterates through the input string `s`.
- It constructs the resulting string `result` by appending characters from `s`.
- It continuously checks if the last character appended to `result` forms a pair with the current character in `s`. If they do, both characters are removed from `result`.
- This process continues until there are no more characters left to check in `s`.

### Time Complexity:
- Similar to the previous approaches, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) since only a single string `result` is used, and it doesn't grow with the input size.

```cpp

// codestorywithMIK
// T.C : O(n)
// S.C : O(1) -> Ignoring the space taken for result string

class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) {
        string result = "";
        
        for(char &ch : s) {
            if(result.size() > 0 && (ch + 32 == result.back() || ch - 32 == result.back())) {
                result.pop_back();
            } else {
                result.push_back(ch);
            }
        }       
        return result;
    }
};

```
