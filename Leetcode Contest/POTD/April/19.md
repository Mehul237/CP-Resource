[Number of Islands -- Code with Alisha](https://youtu.be/FGjqL2330qM?feature=shared) <br>

The code implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to count islands in a 2D grid:
- It iterates through every cell in the grid.
- If a cell is land ('1') and unvisited, it starts a DFS exploration.
- During DFS, it marks the current cell as visited and recursively explores its four neighbors (up, down, left, right) only if they are land and unvisited.
- Each separate DFS exploration represents one island, so the counter is incremented for each starting land cell.

```cpp
// Approach: The code uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore connected land areas in a 2D grid, counting each separate exploration as an island
// TC: O(m * n)
// SC: O(1)

class Solution {
public:

    void fncDFS(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {

        // 1. Out of bound conditon or return condtion, i -- row, j -- column
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size())
            return;

        if (grid[i][j] == '0')
            return;

        // 2. Mark the visited cell before making recursive calls
        grid[i][j] = '0';

        // Make function calls for check up, down, left and right
        fncDFS(grid, i + 1, j);
        fncDFS(grid, i - 1, j);
        fncDFS(grid, i, j + 1);
        fncDFS(grid, i, j - 1);
    }


    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int no_OfIsland = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    fncDFS(grid, i, j);
                    no_OfIsland++;
                }
            }
        }
        return no_OfIsland;
    }
};
```
